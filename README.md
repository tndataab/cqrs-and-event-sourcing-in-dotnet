This repository contains the start code and solutions for the <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-in-net/0636920080710/0636920080709/" target="_blank">CQRS and Event Sourcing in .NET</a> training class. It contains the code needed to follow along in the class.   

The start code for the class is found in the <a href="https://github.com/tndataab/cqrs-and-event-sourcing-in-dotnet/tree/main/source/CQRS%20-%20Start%20project" target="_blank">/source/CQRS - Start project</a> folder.

Feel free to submit issues if you have suggestions for improvements to the code or training class.

The code in the class is influenced by the code and tutorial found at https://cqrs.nu, a site I co-authored with my excellent colleagues.
